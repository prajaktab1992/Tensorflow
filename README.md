# Tensorflow


## Introduction to machine learning

### Why machine learning?

For complex problems we can't write the set of rules always.It will be extensive job.

If we can use some simple rule based system for given problem , no need to use machine learning.

When traditional approach fails machine learning will help. Deep learing can adapt to new scenarios. Discovering insights from large amount of data definitely not the task which can be solved by rule based systems.ML models can adapt for changing environments.

Most of the times patterns learned by ML models are not explainable or uninterpretable by human.Deep learnig models needs fairly good amount of data.

Machine learning generally works well on structured data.DL models generally works well on unstructured data.

### What is tensorflow ?:

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming
